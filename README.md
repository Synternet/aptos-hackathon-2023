# GoingOn
## Aptos Hackathon 2023

GoingOn is a Go application that leverages the power of NATS messaging system and Telegram bot API to process and send real-time notifications for Aptos transactions. The application listens for messages on a specific NATS topic, extracts relevant transaction data, and sends notifications via Telegram bot to specified chat ID.

## Workshop Steps

2. [Step 1: Basic NATS Connecrtion Established](https://gitlab.com/syntropynet/devrel/external/hackathons/aptos-hackathon-2023/1-GoingOn-basic)
3. [Step 2: Added Stream](https://gitlab.com/syntropynet/devrel/external/hackathons/aptos-hackathon-2023/2-GoingOn-added-aptos-stream/)
4. [Step 3: Added Filtering](https://gitlab.com/syntropynet/devrel/external/hackathons/aptos-hackathon-2023/3-GoingOn-added-data-filtering)
5. [Step 4: Added Telegram Bot](https://gitlab.com/syntropynet/devrel/external/hackathons/aptos-hackathon-2023/4-GoinOn-added-telegram-bot)

## Features

- Listens for Aptos transaction messages on a NATS topic.
- Extracts sender address, receiver address, withdrawal amount, and deposit amount from the transaction data.
- Sends real-time notifications with transaction details to a specified Telegram chat ID.
- Handles different types of events within the transaction, including deposit and withdrawal events.
- Provides error handling and logging for improved reliability and troubleshooting.

## Installation

To install and run the GoingOn application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:SyntropyNet/aptos-hackathon-2023.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory if you want to start from a scratch:

   ```shell
   cd aptos-hackathon-2023/0-GoingOn-empty-repo
   ```

   OR test working demo:
      ```shell
   cd aptos-hackathon-2023/GoingOn
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   go mod download
   go get github.com/SyntropyNet/pubsub-go/pubsub
   ```

4. Update the configuration:

   - Update the `natsUrl` constant in the `main.go` file with the appropriate NATS server URL.
   - Update the `accessToken` and in the next steps: `botToken`, and `chatID` constants with the corresponding values for your Telegram bot and chat ID.

5. Build the application:

   ```shell
   make build
   ```

6. Run the application:

   ```shell
   make serve
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that the NATS server is running and accessible (yep - it should be running because we have the best DevOps team in the world).
2. Start the GoingOn application by running the executable generated in the `dist` directory.
3. The application will connect to the NATS server and start listening for Aptos transaction messages.
4. Whenever a relevant transaction message is received, the application will extract the required details and send a notification to the specified Telegram chat ID.


## Makefile Usage
The provided Makefile is used for building, testing, and Dockerizing a Go application. It defines various targets that can be invoked using the `make` command followed by the target name.

Here is a short description of the available targets:

- `gen`: Generate necessary files using `go generate`.
- `build`: Build the production binary of the application using CGO disabled.
- `build-debug`: Build the debug binary of the application.
- `test`: Run all tests in the application.
- `serve`: Run the development version of the program using the specified command (`$(DEV_CMD)`).
- `docker-build`: Build the production Docker image using the specified Dockerfile (`$(DOCKERFILE_PROD)`).
- `docker-build-dev`: Build the development Docker image using the specified Dockerfile (`$(DOCKERFILE_DEV)`).
- `clean`: Remove the build artifacts (delete the `$(DIST_PATH)` directory).
- `all-tests`: Run all tests and build the production Docker image.
- `help`: Display a help message with a summary of the available targets.

To use the Makefile, open a terminal in the project directory and run `make` followed by the target name. For example, to build the production binary, you can run `make build`. Similarly, you can run other targets as needed for building, testing, running, or Dockerizing the application.
